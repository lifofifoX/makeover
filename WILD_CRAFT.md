# WILD_CRAFT.md

Design philosophy for `--wild` mode. **Read this instead of CRAFT.md** when generating experimental proposals.

---

## The Wild Mandate

Wild mode exists to produce designs that **could not be mistaken for normal themes**. The goal is not "polished with edge" — it's genuinely experimental work that pushes boundaries.

### The Litmus Test (Non-Negotiable)

Before finalizing any wild proposal, ask:

**"Would a client say 'this is too weird'?"**
- If NO → **not wild enough, push harder**
- If YES → you're on track

**"Could someone mistake this for a 'normal' theme?"**
- If YES → **not wild enough**
- If NO → proceed

These questions override all other guidance. If your design passes conventional approval, it has failed wild mode.

## What You SHOULD Break

Wild mode grants permission to violate standard craft rules. **Use these freedoms:**

| Normal Rule | Wild Freedom |
|-------------|--------------|
| No pure #000/#FFF | Harsh contrast for brutalist impact, CRT glare, high drama |
| Spacing from 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64 scale | Irregular, tension-creating, deliberately "wrong" spacing |
| One accent color, ≤10% surface | Multiple clashing colors, maximalist saturation, fever dream palettes |
| No decorative elements | Textures, stains, noise, tape, stamps, burns, tears, xerox artifacts |
| Subtle hover states | Aggressive feedback — glitch, shake, invert, corrupt |
| Restrained gradients | Thermal imaging, iridescent oil slicks, corrupted color bands |
| Hierarchy must "squint test" | Hierarchy can be obscured, non-linear, or deliberately challenging |
| Internal consistency | Controlled inconsistency IS a valid organizing principle |
| Clean typography | Distressed, corrupted, mixed fonts, ransom note aesthetics |

### The Freedom Principle

In normal mode, every choice needs justification. In wild mode, **boldness is the justification**. You don't need to defend wild choices to an imaginary design committee. The mandate to be experimental IS the defense.

## Wild Modes

Wild design operates in different modes. Pick one and commit:

### Controlled Chaos
- Clear concept driving the chaos (corrupted file, crime scene, medical emergency)
- Internal logic exists but is unconventional
- Users can eventually navigate, but it takes effort
- Example: A dossier theme where information is "classified" and must be "declassified"

### Committed Chaos
- The organizing principle is disruption itself
- Tension doesn't resolve — it sustains
- Hierarchy is deliberately obscured or subverted
- Example: A ransom note aesthetic where nothing aligns and that's the point

### Sensory Overload
- Maximalist: more is more is more
- Patterns on patterns, colors clashing, elements competing
- The overwhelm IS the experience
- Example: A fever dream collage where visual density creates atmosphere

### Brutalist Rawness
- Sparse, not dense — confrontational through simplicity
- Deliberately unfinished, anti-aesthetic, rejecting polish entirely
- Exposed structure, raw HTML energy, "ugly on purpose"
- Asymmetry from indifference, not from effort
- No decoration — the opposite of Sensory Overload
- Example: Black text on white, system fonts, borders instead of shadows, nothing "designed"

**All four modes are valid.** Don't default to Controlled Chaos because it feels "safer." Brutalist Rawness is wild through rejection of polish, not through adding chaos.

## What Still Matters (Minimal List)

Only these craft elements remain non-negotiable in wild mode:

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Typography correctness** | Curly quotes (" "), proper dashes (– —) — this is accuracy, not style |
| **Functional interactivity** | Buttons must be clickable, links must work |
| **Readable text** | Text can be challenging but not literally illegible |

Everything else is fair game.

## Wild Techniques to Embrace

### Layout Disruption
- **Rotation**: 5-15° angles (not subtle 1-2°)
- **Overlap**: Elements intentionally layered, competing for space
- **Broken grid**: Elements escape their containers
- **Asymmetric splits**: 70/30, 80/20, not balanced
- **Vertical/diagonal text**: Labels, headers, navigation

### Visual Aggression
- **Glitch effects**: RGB split, scan lines, noise, corruption
- **Scale extremes**: 72pt headlines next to 8px labels
- **Color clash**: Intentionally "wrong" combinations
- **Texture overload**: Multiple overlapping textures
- **Harsh transitions**: No smooth gradients — hard cuts

### Typography Extremes
- **Mixed fonts**: Different typefaces in single headlines
- **Distressed text**: Worn, corrupted, fragmenting
- **Ransom note**: Cut-out letters, mixed sizes/styles
- **Vertical orientation**: Rotated labels, sideways navigation

### Conceptual Transforms
- **Data as dossier**: Manila folders, paper clips, redacted sections
- **Interface as artifact**: Worn, stained, aged, damaged
- **Navigation as metaphor**: File tabs, TV channels, elevator buttons, radio dials
- **Tables as documents**: Police blotter, medical chart, telegram, ship's log

## Anti-Patterns (Even in Wild Mode)

These specific effects are overused and banned:

| Banned | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Horizontal scan line** (animated line scrolling top-to-bottom) | Cliché CRT effect |
| **Full-screen glitch on load** | Predictable, overwhelming |
| **Subtle wildness** | Defeats the purpose — go hard or go home |
| **"A little bit of everything"** | Pick a direction and commit |

## The Wild Standard

Ask: **"Would David Carson think this is bold enough?"**

NOT "is it trying too hard" — in wild mode, trying hard IS the point.

Wild design that works:
- **Commits** to its choices (no hedging)
- **Sustains** tension (resolution optional)
- Is **memorable** (people will have opinions)
- **Couldn't exist** in normal mode (it required --wild)

Wild design that fails:
- Hedges with safe choices alongside wild ones
- Backs off at the last moment
- Could pass as "edgy normal"
- Plays it safe while pretending to be experimental

---

## The Final Wild Test

Before submitting a wild proposal:

1. **Would a client reject this as "too much"?** → If no, push harder
2. **Does it commit fully to its concept?** → No half-measures
3. **Is it genuinely experimental?** → Not just "normal + filter"
4. **Would it be impossible in normal mode?** → The wildness should be structural, not decorative

**The wild mandate:** Make something that could only exist because someone asked for wild.
