# Wild Mode Proposal Guide

Read captured content from **tmp/makeover/capture/**. DNA is optional — use `DNA: FREEFORM`.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

**Read TEMPLATE.md for the exact HTML structure.** Your proposal MUST have all 5 sections:

1. Theme Header (name, concept, structural mutation, references)
2. Color Palette (swatches with HSL values, palette name, story)
3. App Content (your wild redesign with real content)
4. UI Elements (buttons, inputs, cards, alerts, modal, loading, empty)
5. Motion Showcase (interactive demos)

**Missing any section = invalid proposal.**

**Before generating:** Invoke the frontend-design plugin.

## Wild Mode Checklist

### Structural (What Makes It Wild)
- [ ] At least ONE structural mutation (page, navigation, hierarchy, or interaction)
- [ ] NOT the same page structure as original
- [ ] NOT the same navigation model
- [ ] Passes decoration test: couldn't be a normal theme with different colors

### Content
- [ ] All captured content present (restructured is fine)
- [ ] 2-3 specific references cited
- [ ] NOT: conspiracy board, evidence locker, fortune teller, arcade cabinet, specimen, escape room

### Showcase Sections
- [ ] Section 1: Theme Header with name, concept, mutation, references
- [ ] Section 2: Color Palette with 5-7 HSL swatches and story
- [ ] Section 3: App Content with real data from capture
- [ ] Section 4: UI Elements — standard + app-specific from capture
- [ ] Section 5: Motion Showcase demonstrating interactions

**App-specific elements:** Check capture files for elements unique to this app. If unsure, use `AskUserQuestion` before generating.

## Structural Mutations (Choose One)

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Page** | Collapse all into one scroll, fragment into scattered artifacts, dissolve into spatial layout |
| **Navigation** | Nav becomes content, discovery-based, abolished entirely, environmental |
| **Hierarchy** | Invert (metadata becomes hero), flatten, make dynamic on interaction |
| **Interaction** | Passive (time-based), friction (earn access), ambient (responds to presence) |

---

## Visual Techniques (Supplement Structure)

- Rotation 5-15°, overlap, broken grid, asymmetric splits
- Scale extremes, color clash, texture overload
- Mixed fonts, ransom note, vertical text

---

## Banned

**Concepts:** Conspiracy board, evidence locker, fortune teller, arcade cabinet, specimen display, escape room

**Visuals:** Neon pink+cyan, Matrix green, horizontal CRT scanlines

## The Wild Standard

Could someone implement this as a normal theme? → Must be **NO**
