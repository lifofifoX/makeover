# Wild Mode Proposal Guide

**Complete reference for wild mode proposal agents.**

Read captured content from **tmp/makeover/capture/**. DNA is optional — use `DNA: FREEFORM` for structural experimentation.

---

## The Wild Mandate

Wild mode produces designs that **question fundamental interface assumptions**. Visual wild is not enough — you must achieve **structural wild**.

### Litmus Tests (Non-Negotiable)

| Test | Question | Required Answer |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Decoration Test** | Could someone implement this as a normal theme with different colors? | NO |
| **Structure Test** | Does this challenge how the app fundamentally works? | YES |
| **Skeleton Test** | Strip away all visual styling. Is the UX still wild? | YES |

**If any test fails, push harder on structural transformation.**

## Checklist (Verify Before Submitting)

### Structural Requirements (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **At least ONE structural mutation applied** — page, navigation, hierarchy, or interaction
- [ ] **NOT the same page structure** as original app
- [ ] **NOT the same navigation model** (even if reskinned)
- [ ] **NOT the same user journey** with wild visuals

### Standard Requirements
- [ ] **NOT an overused concept** — no conspiracy board, evidence locker, fortune teller, arcade cabinet, specimen, escape room
- [ ] **Color palette** with evocative name, 5-7 colors, color story
- [ ] **2-3 specific references cited**
- [ ] **All captured content shown** (can be restructured)
- [ ] **UI Elements section** — buttons, inputs, cards, alerts, modals, loading, empty states

### Craft (Still Applies)
- [ ] **Typography correctness** — curly quotes (" "), proper dashes (– —)
- [ ] **Functional interactivity** — clickable things work
- [ ] **Core content accessible** — users can eventually find/read everything

## Structural Mutations (Choose At Least One)

### Page Mutations

| Mutation | What It Does | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Collapse** | All pages become one continuous experience | Profile + Activity + Settings = one infinite scroll |
| **Fragment** | Single logical "page" scattered as artifacts | User profile as scattered documents on a canvas |
| **Dissolve** | No pages exist, content is spatial | Everything floats in explorable 2D space |
| **Invert** | Metadata becomes content, content recedes | Timestamps and tags are hero, actual data is ambient |
| **Archaeology** | Layers reveal history | Scroll to "dig" through time layers |

### Navigation Mutations

| Mutation | What It Does | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **As Content** | Clicking nav reveals content in-place | "About" expands into about content, no page change |
| **Discovery** | Users must find paths | Content hidden until discovered through exploration |
| **Abolished** | No explicit nav exists | Users scroll/swipe through continuous experience |
| **Temporal** | Structure changes over time | New sections appear based on session duration |
| **Environmental** | Navigate by moving through space | Scroll direction changes what content appears |
| **Puzzle** | Users solve to navigate | Correct interaction sequence unlocks sections |

### Hierarchy Mutations

| Mutation | What It Does | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Inversion** | Secondary info becomes primary | Dates and metadata are huge, content is small |
| **Flat** | Everything at same visual weight | No emphasis, user decides importance |
| **Dynamic** | Importance shifts with interaction | Hovered items grow, others shrink |
| **Relationship** | Connections matter more than items | Lines between items are the feature |
| **Absence** | Missing things are prominent | Empty spaces, gaps, voids as design |

### Interaction Mutations

| Mutation | What It Does | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Passive** | Content appears without action | Information surfaces based on time, not clicks |
| **Friction** | Deliberately difficult | Users must "earn" access through puzzles |
| **Destructive** | Using changes/destroys | Viewed items disappear, visited paths close |
| **Ambient** | Responds to presence | Hover time, scroll speed affect display |
| **Accumulative** | Builds over session | More content appears the longer you stay |

## Visual Wild Techniques (Supplement, Not Substitute)

These add to structural transformation but don't replace it.

### Layout Disruption
- **Rotation**: 5-15° angles (not subtle 1-2°)
- **Overlap**: Elements intentionally competing for space
- **Broken grid**: Elements escape their containers
- **Asymmetric splits**: 70/30, 80/20, not balanced
- **Vertical/diagonal text**: Labels, headers, navigation

### Visual Aggression
- **Glitch effects**: RGB split, scan lines, noise, corruption
- **Scale extremes**: 72pt headlines next to 8px labels
- **Color clash**: Intentionally "wrong" combinations
- **Texture overload**: Multiple overlapping textures
- **Harsh transitions**: No smooth gradients — hard cuts

### Typography Extremes
- **Mixed fonts**: Different typefaces in single headlines
- **Distressed text**: Worn, corrupted, fragmenting
- **Ransom note**: Cut-out letters, mixed sizes/styles
- **Vertical orientation**: Rotated labels, sideways navigation

## Rules You SHOULD Break

| Normal Rule | Wild Freedom |
|-------------|--------------|
| No pure #000/#FFF | Harsh contrast creates tension |
| Spacing scale only | Irregular gaps signal intention |
| Hierarchy must squint-test | Obscured hierarchy forces engagement |
| One accent, ≤10% | Clashing colors create energy |
| Subtle hover states | Aggressive feedback is memorable |
| Proportional sizing | Extreme contrast creates drama |
| Consistent radii | Mixed radii create unpredictability |

### Structural Rules to Break (MANDATORY)

| Normal Rule | Wild Transformation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Pages follow app structure | Collapsed, fragmented, dissolved |
| Navigation in header/sidebar | Anywhere, nowhere, or IS content |
| Content displayed directly | Hidden, revealed, discovered |
| Linear user journey | Non-linear, exploratory, surprising |
| Clear information architecture | Ambiguous, emergent, puzzling |

---

## Color Palette Creation

**Create an original palette that serves your structural concept.** Wild mode allows rule-breaking, but break rules with intention.

### Requirements

1. **Use HSL** — even when breaking rules, HSL makes relationships clear
2. **5-7 colors** — can be high contrast, clashing, or unconventional
3. **Evocative name** — match your structural concept
4. **Color story** — explain the intentional discomfort or energy

### Wild Freedoms

In wild mode, you MAY:
- Use pure `#000000` / `#FFFFFF` for harsh contrast
- Use clashing colors intentionally
- Break the 60-30-10 rule
- Oversaturate or desaturate extremely

But you MUST:
- Do it intentionally, not by accident
- Explain why in your color story
- Ensure it serves the structural concept

### Banned Patterns (Still Apply)

| Pattern | Why | Alternative |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Neon pink + cyan | Cyberpunk cliché | Other unexpected clashes |
| Matrix green on black | 1999 | Different "digital" approaches |
| Generic "glitch" colors | Lazy | Concept-specific palette |
| Copying famous brand palettes | Derivative | Original combinations |

### Direction Hints

| Mood | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Tension | High contrast, complementary clash |
| Unease | Slight desaturation, "wrong" combinations |
| Aggression | Saturated primaries, no soft tones |
| Decay | Muted, brownish, low saturation |
| Digital | Harsh, limited palette, stark contrast |

## Typography Pairings

### Brutalist Expression
| Role | Font |
|------|------|
| Headlines | Druk Wide Heavy |
| Impact | Obviously Variable |
| Body | Suisse Int'l Regular |

*Alternatives: Knockout, Tungsten, Monument Extended*

### Terminal
| Role | Font |
|------|------|
| All | Berkeley Mono |
| Emphasis | Berkeley Mono Bold |

*Alternatives: Iosevka, Fira Code, Victor Mono*

### Technical Precision
| Role | Font |
|------|------|
| Headlines | GT America Mono Bold |
| Body | GT America Regular |
| Data | JetBrains Mono |

### Mixed Chaos
Intentionally mismatched:
- Headlines: Mix serif + sans in same line
- Ransom note: Different fonts per word
- Vertical: Rotated labels

---

## Banned Patterns

### Structural Anti-Patterns
| Banned | Why | Alternative |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Same pages, different skin | Not structural wild | Collapse, fragment, dissolve |
| Navigation reskinned as tabs/dials | Still conventional | Navigation as content, or abolished |
| List restyled as cards | Still a list | Spatial, temporal, discovery model |
| "Wild looking" same journey | Just decoration | Transform the journey itself |

### Visual Anti-Patterns
| Banned | Why | Alternative |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Horizontal CRT scan line | Cliché | Vertical interference, diagonal static |
| Full-screen glitch on load | Predictable | Localized glitch on interaction |
| Neon pink + cyan | Cyberpunk cliché | Unexpected color clash |
| Matrix falling code | 1999 | Static corruption, data viz |
| Generic glitch filter | Lazy | Hand-crafted corruption |

### Overused Concepts (Do Not Use)
- Conspiracy Board — red string, polaroids
- Evidence Locker — police evidence bags
- Fortune Teller — tarot, crystal ball
- Arcade Cabinet — pixel fonts, insert coin
- Specimen Display — museum labels
- Escape Room — puzzles, locks, clues

## Pre-Submit Verification (REQUIRED)

Before writing the HTML file, state aloud:

1. **Structural Check**: "My structural mutation is [X]. The original app had [structure], my version has [different structure]"
2. **Decoration Test**: "This could NOT be implemented as a normal theme because [specific structural reason]"
3. **Content Check**: "I am using real content from capture: [list 3 specific text items]"
4. **Palette Check**: "My palette [name] uses HSL. I'm [breaking/following] normal rules because [reason]. Colors: hsl(...), hsl(...)"
5. **References Check**: "My 2-3 references are: [specific items, not categories]"
6. **Banned Check**: "I verified this is NOT a conspiracy board, evidence locker, fortune teller, arcade cabinet, specimen display, or escape room"

**If any check fails, revise before writing the file.**

## Agent Prompt Template

```
You are creating a WILD MODE PROPOSAL. Visual wild alone is NOT sufficient.

## Read First
1. tmp/makeover/capture/manifest.json — pages, styling system
2. tmp/makeover/capture/{page}.snapshot — DOM captures
3. tmp/makeover/constraints.json — your assigned structural mutation

## MANDATORY: Choose Structural Mutation

PAGE MUTATION:
- Collapse: All pages → one continuous experience
- Fragment: Content scattered as artifacts on canvas
- Dissolve: No pages, spatial/temporal flow
- Invert: Metadata becomes hero, content becomes ambient

NAVIGATION MUTATION:
- As Content: Nav items ARE content, expand in-place
- Discovery: Hidden paths users must find
- Abolished: No nav, continuous scroll/experience
- Temporal: Structure changes over session time

## Assignment
Theme: {NAME}
Structure: {Describe your structural mutation OR use DNA: FREEFORM}
References: {2-3 SPECIFIC items}
Palette: {name} with 5-7 colors
Styling: {Tailwind|CSS Modules|vanilla}

## Output
File: tmp/makeover/themes/{name}.html
- All CSS in <style>, fonts via Google CDN
- Invoke frontend-design plugin first

## Required Sections
1. Theme header (name, structure/DNA, references)
2. Color palette with swatches and story
3. Restructured app content (NOT same page structure)
4. UI Elements (buttons, inputs, cards, alerts, modals, loading, empty)
5. Motion/interaction showcase

## Content Rules
- Use ACTUAL content from captured pages
- Restructure freely — collapse, fragment, dissolve
- ACTUAL image URLs from app — no emoji, no placeholder.com
- If no images: realistic internet images fitting context

## Metadata (Top of HTML)
<!--
MAKEOVER_METADATA
theme: {name}
structure: {mutation description or DNA}
styling_system: {system}
pages: {comma-separated list}
wild_mode: true
-->

## Pre-Submit Verification
Before writing, state aloud your Structural, Decoration, Content, Palette, References, and Banned checks.

## Quality Gates
1. Structural test — Did I transform pages/navigation/hierarchy?
2. Decoration test — Could this be normal theme with color swap? (must be NO)
3. Confusion test — Would familiar user be momentarily disoriented?
4. Real content — No placeholders, no emoji substitutes

Return: theme name, structure description, palette name, references, file path
```

## The Wild Standard

**"Would David Carson think this is bold enough?"**
**"Would this confuse someone expecting a normal app?"**

Wild design that works:
- **Commits** to structural transformation, not just visual
- **Challenges** fundamental UX assumptions
- Is **disorienting** in an intentional way
- **Couldn't exist** as a "normal theme with wild styling"

Wild design that fails:
- Hedges with conventional structure
- Could be achieved with a color palette swap
- Keeps the same pages, navigation, and journey
