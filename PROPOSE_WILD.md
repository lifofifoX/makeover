## The Wild Mandate

Wild mode exists to produce designs that **question the fundamental assumptions of the interface itself**. Visual wild is not enough — you must achieve **structural wild**.

### Two Levels of Wild

| Level | Description | Sufficient? |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Level 1: Visual** | Unusual colors, textures, typography, glitch effects | NO |
| **Level 2: Structural** | Reimagined pages, navigation, hierarchy, interaction | YES |

**You must operate at Level 2.** Visual changes alone are not wild.

### Litmus Tests (Non-Negotiable)

**Test 1: "Could someone implement this as a normal theme with different colors?"**
- If YES → not wild enough, you've only done visual wild
- If NO → you've achieved structural wild

**Test 2: "Does this challenge how the app fundamentally works?"**
- If NO → you're just decorating
- If YES → proceed

**Test 3: "Strip away all visual styling. Is the UX still wild?"**
- If NO → push harder on structural transformation
- If YES → you're on track

## Checklist (Verify Before Submitting)

### Structural Requirements (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **At least ONE structural mutation applied** — page, navigation, hierarchy, or interaction
- [ ] **NOT the same page structure** as original app
- [ ] **NOT the same navigation model** (even if reskinned)
- [ ] **NOT the same user journey** with wild visuals

### Standard Requirements
- [ ] **NOT an overused concept** — no conspiracy board, evidence locker, fortune teller, arcade cabinet, specimen, escape room
- [ ] **Color palette** with evocative name, 5-7 colors, color story
- [ ] **2-3 specific references cited**
- [ ] **All captured content shown** (can be restructured)
- [ ] **UI Elements section** — buttons, inputs, cards, alerts, modals, loading, empty states, plus app-specific

### Craft Elements (Still Apply)
- [ ] **Typography correctness** — curly quotes (" "), proper dashes (– —)
- [ ] **Functional interactivity** — clickable things work
- [ ] **Core content accessible** — users can eventually find/read everything

## Structural Mutations (Choose At Least One)

### Page Mutations

| Mutation | What It Does | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Page Collapse** | All pages become one continuous experience | Profile + Activity + Settings = one infinite scroll |
| **Page Fragmentation** | Single logical "page" scattered as artifacts | User profile as scattered documents on a canvas |
| **Page Dissolution** | No pages exist, content is spatial | Everything floats in explorable 2D space |
| **Page Inversion** | Metadata becomes content, content recedes | Timestamps and tags are hero, actual data is ambient |
| **Page Archaeology** | Layers reveal history | Scroll to "dig" through time layers |

### Navigation Mutations

| Mutation | What It Does | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Navigation as Content** | Clicking nav reveals content in-place | "About" expands into about content, no page change |
| **Discovery Navigation** | Users must find paths | Content hidden until discovered through exploration |
| **Abolished Navigation** | No explicit nav exists | Users scroll/swipe through continuous experience |
| **Temporal Navigation** | Structure changes over time | New sections appear based on session duration |
| **Environmental Navigation** | Navigate by moving through space | Scroll direction changes what content appears |
| **Puzzle Navigation** | Users solve to navigate | Correct interaction sequence unlocks sections |

### Hierarchy Mutations

| Mutation | What It Does | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Hierarchy Inversion** | Secondary info becomes primary | Dates and metadata are huge, content is small |
| **Flat Hierarchy** | Everything at same visual weight | No emphasis, user decides importance |
| **Dynamic Hierarchy** | Importance shifts with interaction | Hovered items grow, others shrink |
| **Relationship Hierarchy** | Connections matter more than items | Lines between items are the feature |
| **Absence Hierarchy** | Missing things are prominent | Empty spaces, gaps, voids as design |

### Interaction Mutations

| Mutation | What It Does | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Passive Interface** | Content appears without action | Information surfaces based on time, not clicks |
| **Friction Interface** | Deliberately difficult | Users must "earn" access through puzzles |
| **Destructive Interface** | Using changes/destroys | Viewed items disappear, visited paths close |
| **Ambient Interface** | Responds to presence | Hover time, scroll speed affect display |
| **Accumulative Interface** | Builds over session | More content appears the longer you stay |

---

## Structural Wild Examples

### Instead of: Homepage + Profile + Settings + Activity
- **Collapse**: One infinite narrative scroll, sections blend into each other
- **Fragment**: All four as scattered papers on a detective's desk
- **Dissolve**: Float through a space where each "page" is a region you drift into

### Instead of: List Page with Filters
- **Spatial**: Items exist in 2D space, zoom and pan to explore
- **Temporal**: Items appear one by one on a timer, can't skip ahead
- **Discovery**: All items hidden, revealed by interacting with related concepts

### Instead of: Nav Header with Links
- **As Content**: Clicking "Projects" doesn't navigate, it BECOMES the projects inline
- **Environmental**: Scroll direction determines which "section" you're in
- **Abolished**: No nav, just one long continuous experience, landmarks guide

---

## DNA System (OPTIONAL)

In wild mode, the DNA system is **optional**. You may:

1. **Use standard DNA** if it serves your concept
2. **Use `DNA: FREEFORM`** to indicate structural experimentation
3. **Declare custom structure concept** instead of DNA codes

### If Using DNA

| Code | Category | Options |
|------|----------|---------|
| H1-H12 | Header | Top bar, sidebars, floating, split, bottom, hidden, diagonal, peripheral |
| L1-L12 | Home Layout | Bio+grid, hero+list, magazine, dashboard, scroll story, bento, collage |
| G1-G12 | Collection | 2-4+ columns, single list, table, masonry, horizontal scroll, scattered |
| D1-D12 | Detail Split | 50/50, reversed, stacked, media/info dominant, overlay, tabbed, theater |
| C1-C12 | Cards | Square, portrait, landscape, text row, polaroid, index card, specimen |
| N1-N9 | Motion | Static to chaotic |

**D1 (standard 50/50) is discouraged** — use D6 (overlay), D8 (full bleed + drawer), D9 (theater), or thematic alternatives.

### Custom Structure Declaration

Instead of `H4-L1-G3-D1-C2-N5`, declare:
```
STRUCTURE: All content exists on one infinite scroll. Navigation is discovery.
STRUCTURE: Pages don't exist. Interface is a single explorable space.
STRUCTURE: The navigation IS the content. Clicking nav items reveals their substance.
```

## Visual Wild Techniques (Supplement, Not Substitute)

These add to structural transformation but don't replace it.

### Layout Disruption
- **Rotation**: 5-15° angles (not subtle 1-2°)
- **Overlap**: Elements intentionally competing for space
- **Broken grid**: Elements escape their containers
- **Asymmetric splits**: 70/30, 80/20, not balanced
- **Vertical/diagonal text**: Labels, headers, navigation

### Visual Aggression
- **Glitch effects**: RGB split, scan lines, noise, corruption
- **Scale extremes**: 72pt headlines next to 8px labels
- **Color clash**: Intentionally "wrong" combinations
- **Texture overload**: Multiple overlapping textures
- **Harsh transitions**: No smooth gradients — hard cuts

### Typography Extremes
- **Mixed fonts**: Different typefaces in single headlines
- **Distressed text**: Worn, corrupted, fragmenting
- **Ransom note**: Cut-out letters, mixed sizes/styles
- **Vertical orientation**: Rotated labels, sideways navigation

## What You SHOULD Break

| Normal Rule | Wild Freedom |
|-------------|--------------|
| No pure #000/#FFF | Harsh contrast for brutalist impact |
| Spacing scale only | Irregular, tension-creating, deliberately "wrong" |
| One accent color, ≤10% | Multiple clashing colors, maximalist saturation |
| No decorative elements | Textures, stains, noise, tape, stamps, burns |
| Subtle hover states | Aggressive feedback — glitch, shake, invert |
| Hierarchy must squint-test | Hierarchy can be obscured, non-linear, challenging |
| **Pages follow app structure** | **Pages collapsed, fragmented, dissolved** |
| **Navigation in header/sidebar** | **Navigation anywhere, nowhere, or AS content** |
| **Content displayed directly** | **Content hidden, revealed, discovered** |

---

## What Still Matters

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Typography correctness** | Curly quotes (" "), proper dashes — accuracy, not style |
| **Functional interactivity** | Things that should be clickable must work |
| **Core content accessible** | Users can eventually find/read content (even if difficult) |

Everything else is fair game.

---

## Banned Patterns

### Structural Anti-Patterns
| Banned | Why | Alternative |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Same pages, different skin | Not structural wild | Collapse, fragment, or dissolve |
| Navigation reskinned as tabs/dials | Still conventional nav | Navigation as content, or abolished |
| List restyled as cards | Still a list | Spatial, temporal, or discovery model |
| "Wild looking" but same journey | Just decoration | Transform the user journey itself |

### Visual Anti-Patterns
| Banned | Why | Alternative |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Horizontal CRT scan line | Cliché | Vertical interference, diagonal static |
| Full-screen glitch on load | Predictable | Localized glitch on interaction |
| Neon pink + cyan | Cyberpunk cliché | Unexpected color clash |
| Matrix falling code | 1999 called | Static corruption, data viz |
| Generic glitch filter | Lazy | Hand-crafted corruption specific to concept |

### Overused Concepts (Do Not Use)
These are first-instinct defaults. Pick something else.

- **Conspiracy Board** — red string, polaroids, "connecting the dots"
- **Evidence Locker** — police evidence bags, case numbers, chain of custody
- **Fortune Teller** — tarot, crystal ball, mystical readings
- **Arcade Cabinet** — pixel fonts, insert coin, high scores
- **Specimen Display** — museum labels, scientific classification
- **Escape Room** — puzzles, locks, clues, inventory

## UI Elements

Include a UI Elements section: buttons, form inputs, cards, alerts, modals, loading states, empty states — plus any app-specific elements derived from the captured UI.

---

## Agent Prompt Template

```
You are creating a WILD MODE PROPOSAL. Visual wild alone is NOT sufficient.

## MANDATORY: Structural Transformation

Choose at least ONE structural mutation:

PAGE MUTATION:
- Collapse: All pages become one continuous experience
- Fragment: Content scattered as artifacts on single canvas
- Dissolve: No pages, spatial/temporal content flow
- Invert: Metadata becomes hero, content becomes ambient

NAVIGATION MUTATION:
- As Content: Nav items ARE content, expand in-place
- Discovery: Hidden paths users must find
- Abolished: No nav, continuous scroll/experience
- Temporal: Structure changes over session time

## Captured App Content

{PAGES_CONTENT}
<!-- Content to restructure, not preserve -->

## Assignment

Theme: {NAME}
Structure: {Describe your structural mutation OR use DNA: FREEFORM}
References: {cite 2-3 SPECIFIC items from this file}
Palette: {name} with 5-7 colors
Styling System: {detected: Tailwind/CSS Modules/vanilla}

## Output

File: tmp/makeover/themes/{name}.html
- All CSS in <style>, fonts via Google CDN only
- Invoke frontend-design plugin first

## Required Sections
1. Theme header (name, structure/DNA, references)
2. Color palette with swatches and story
3. Restructured app content (NOT same page structure)
4. UI Elements (see section above)
5. Motion/interaction showcase

## Content Rules
- Use ACTUAL content from captured pages
- Restructure freely — collapse pages, fragment, dissolve
- ACTUAL image URLs from app — no emoji, no placeholder.com
- If no images: realistic internet images fitting context

## Embed Metadata (Top of HTML)

<!--
MAKEOVER_METADATA
theme: {name}
structure: {mutation description or DNA}
styling_system: {Tailwind|CSS Modules|vanilla}
pages: {comma-separated list}
wild_mode: true
-->

## Quality Gates (All Must Pass)
1. Structural test — Did I transform pages/navigation/hierarchy?
2. Decoration test — Could this be normal theme with color swap? (must be NO)
3. Confusion test — Would familiar user be momentarily disoriented?
4. Real content — No placeholders, no emoji substitutes

Return: theme name, structure description, palette name, references, file path
```

## The Wild Standard

Ask: **"Would David Carson think this is bold enough?"**
Ask: **"Would this confuse someone expecting a normal app?"**

Wild design that works:
- **Commits** to structural transformation, not just visual
- **Challenges** fundamental UX assumptions
- Is **disorienting** in an intentional way
- **Couldn't exist** as a "normal theme with wild styling"

Wild design that fails:
- Hedges with conventional structure
- Could be achieved with a color palette swap
- Keeps the same pages, navigation, and journey

**The wild mandate:** Make something that questions not just how the app looks, but how it fundamentally works.
